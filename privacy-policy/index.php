                <h2>Feedback Tool privacy policy.</h2>
                <br>
                This policy explains how your data is used by Feedback Tool. Please don't use this website if you do not agree to this policy.

                <h4>Information for session facilitators</h4>
                <br>
                When you create a new session using Feedback Tool the data you enter (session title, session date, facilitator name and facilitator email address), and the timestamp, is submitted to a server located within the United Kingdom. The transmission of your data is protected using SSL encryption, and is stored in an access controlled database, but cannot be guarranteed to be completely secure. This data will be stored for up to 5 years from the point of submission after which time it will be deleted. After the session is created an email will be sent to the facilitator email confirming the session details and how to access the feedback form. You should only enter your own email address as the facilitator email address, or with the express permission of the facilitator if you are creating a session on their behalf.
                <br><br>
                Anyone who accesses the feedback form for your session (via the session ID, link or QR code) can view the session title, session date and facilitator name, but not the facilitator email address.
                <br><br>
                If you want your data to be removed from the database (for example if you no longer want to receive feedback for a particular session) please email <a href="mailto:web@danleach.uk">web@danleach.uk</a> with the session ID and the email used.
                <br><br><br>
                <h4>Information for session attendees</h4>
                <br>
                When you provide feedback using Feedback Tool the data you enter (positive comments, constructive comments and overall score), together with the ID for the session you are providing feedback for, is submitted to a server located within the United Kingdom. The transmission of your data is protected using SSL encryption, and is stored in an access controlled database, but cannot be guarranteed to be completely secure. This data will be stored for up to 5 years from the point of submission after which time it will be deleted. After the feedback is logged an email will be sent to the faciltator email with your positive comments, constructive comments and overall score. This email cannot be recalled once sent, so please take care when submitting feedback.
                <br><br>
                Neither the facilitator, nor Feedback Tool, can identify you during the feedback submission process. The feedback database does not log your IP address or other identifying features about your device. However, bear in mind that comments you make might allow you to be identified. As the email containing your feedback is sent immediately to the facilitator you should avoid letting them know the time you submitted your feedback as this could be used to identify you.
                <br><br>
                If you want your data to be removed from the database please email <a href="mailto:web@danleach.uk">web@danleach.uk</a> with the details of your feedback. As your feedback is not directly attributable to you, you will need to provide details regarding the feedback text to allow the entry to be identified and removed.
